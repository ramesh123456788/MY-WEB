<h2>HORSE</h2>
<p>Horses have always been associated with speed. Since we were kids, horses have been introduced as a form of transport. But horses are also good and loyal companions. It is difficult nowadays to see horses often, except on the beaches and tourist spots. In India, horses are used for tourist recreation, for weddings etc.
